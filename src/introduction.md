# Introduction

This is a reference-style book for external tooling in the Roblox ecosystem.

It aims to teach Roblox developers about external tools and workflows to help
you be more productive and discover the knowledge you need.

This book aggregates a lot of community wisdom that is often not covered by
official documentation, saving you the need to struggle with issues that others
have figured out already!

While it aims to be exhaustive, Roblox's open-source community is a moving
target and covering everything is a monumental task. I focus my time on whatever
I believe the community needs most.

Therefore, there are still a lot of omissions, both for basic and advanced
topics. Nevertheless, I am confident this book will prove to be a valuable
resource to you!

**Welcome! May this book serve you well!**

## Is this book up to date?

External Roblox tooling is a very broad topic with lots of moving parts. Each
tool and library mentioned in this book is an individual moving target and could
potentially be several major releases ahead of when the book was last updated.

That said, this book primarily focuses on *ideas* and *concepts*, rather than
specific implementations. Though it may not always be perfectly up-to-date, the
ideas presented should transfer.

If you spot any content that is out-of-date, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/roblox-cheatbook/roblox-cheatbook/issues/new) to make me aware.
