Describe what you want to be added or changed in the book here, as a GitHub
Issue. If you have any relevant code snippets or something else you want to be
included, you can provide them.

Please do not create Pull Requests, unless it is for a trivial fix
(typo, code bug, etc.).

I prefer an issue-driven workflow. Tell me what you want, and I will figure out
how to present it in the book. :)
