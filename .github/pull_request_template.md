# PLEASE DO NOT CREATE PULL REQUESTS FOR BOOK CONTENT

The only exception to this might be trivial fixes. If you are just fixing
a typo or small mistake, or a bug in some code example, that's fine.

If you are adding or changing any of the book content, your PR will probably be
ignored or closed. I will probably treat it like I do issues: go do the thing
myself eventually, and then close your PR.

---

If you want something to be added or changed in the book, *file an issue!* Tell
me what you want, and I will figure out how to present it in the book. If you
have some code snippet or other thing you want to be in the book, you can
include it in the issue.

That sort of workflow works much better for me. I am quite opinionated and
meticulous about how everything is presented in the book, so I often can't just
merge/accept things as written by someone else.
